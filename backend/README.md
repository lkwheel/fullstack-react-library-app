The Library App is a Spring Boot/Java API that uses Otka/Auth0 for Basic Access Control Code

This Java code sample demonstrates **how to implement authorization** in Spring API servers using Auth0.

This code sample is part of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources), a place where you can explore the authentication and authorization features of the Auth0 Identity Platform.

Visit the ["Spring/Java Code Sample: Authorization For Basic APIs"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/api/spring/basic-authorization) page for instructions of extending this capability.
